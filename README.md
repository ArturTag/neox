# GPTNeoX20B_HuggingFace

This code is used to running GPT NeoX 20B using HuggingFace.

## Requirements

Ideally you have one or more GPUs that total 48GB of VRAM or more.

However, even if you don't you can still run the model it will just take much longer.  

For example, running with one 3090 rather than two would take around 10 minutes to generate 100 tokens vs 10-30 seconds if you ran it one two GPUs.

If you don't have enough VRAM you need to make sure you have enough RAM to make up for it.
